Mount & Blade 2 : Bannerlord mod that adds more weapons

This mod adds fun weapons to play with. Absolutely NOT realistic or lore-friendly.

All weapons are available in stores and in the cheat menu.

Weapons :
- Portable Artillery (same as siege boulders, but more portable and powerful)
- Really Fast Stone (same as throwing rocks, but way more fun)
- Long Arrows (ballista arrows)
- Fiery Long Arrows (fiery ballista arrows)
- Powerful Crossbow (very powerful crossbow that shoots arrows)
- Repeating Crossbow (like the Powerful Crossbow but holds 10 ammo)

I will add more weapons over time.
