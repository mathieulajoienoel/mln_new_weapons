Mount & Blade 2 : Bannerlord mod that adds more weapons

This mod adds fun weapons to play with. Absolutely NOT realistic or lore-friendly.

Almost all weapons are available in stores and all are in the cheat menu.

Weapons :
- Portable Artillery (Same as siege boulders, but more portable and powerful)
- Really Fast Stone (Same as throwing rocks, but way more fun)
- Long Arrows (Ballista arrows)
- Fiery Long Arrows (Fiery ballista arrows)
- Powerful Crossbow (Very powerful crossbow that shoots arrows)
- Repeating Crossbow (Like the Powerful Crossbow but holds 10 ammo)
- Ball Crusher (Most powerful wooden sword)

The Ball Crusher is not available in stores but it is craftable. It is also accessible from the cheat menu.

I will add more weapons over time.
